## 📘 DSA Preparation Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice code, implemented in **Java** using **Eclipse IDE**.

The primary purpose of this repository is:
- For my own **reference** and **revision** while preparing for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.
- To keep all my DSA solutions organized in one place for easy access and review.

All code is written with a focus on clarity and understanding of the underlying concepts.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `src/` - Contains all Java source code for different DSA topics.
  - `Arrays/` - Array-related problems
  - `Dynamic_Programming/` - DP problems
  - `Graphs/` - Graph algorithms
  - `LinkedList/` - Linked List implementations
  - `Stacks_Queues/` - Stack and Queue problems
  - `Trees/` - Binary Tree, BST problems
  
## 📌 Notes
- All code files are self-contained with a `main` method for testing.
- Code is primarily for learning and revision purposes.
