## 📘 DSA Preparation Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice code, implemented in **Java** using **Eclipse IDE**.  

The primary purpose of this repository is:  
- For my own **reference** and **revision** while preparing for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.  
- To keep all my DSA solutions organized in one place for easy access and review.  

All code is written with a focus on clarity and understanding of the underlying concepts.
